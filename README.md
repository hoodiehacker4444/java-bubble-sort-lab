# java-bubble-sort-lab
A java lab which has a bubble sorting algorithm fully written out and tested on it.

# Detailed-Description:
Main method in Statistician.java
It currently has an array with 4 elements placed in random, backward sorted, and sorted order to test the bubble sort algorithm. 
It also has a getstats function that repeats the bubble sorting algorithm on a random array N_REPITITIONS times, and counts the
number of times the bubble sort algorithm visits the array, swaps elements in the array, average swaps, and average visits. 
The main method currently runs getstats() for 1000 repititions and 3000 repititions.

# How to run
